## Overview

Prax is a framework for organising state and side effects in React applications.
It's heavily inspired by Redux, Clojure, ClojureScript libraries, and has been
battle-tested in large apps since 2015.

Prax is not buzzword-driven. It's built on solid ideas carefully pilfered from
several languages and frameworks. It doesn't subscribe to an ideology. It's not
particularly functional, object-oriented, or FRP-centric, it doesn't "follow the
leader" to gain fame, it tries very hard to be general and not over-abstract,
and it attacks real, hard problems.

## Inspiration

* Clojure, `clojure.core`: functional data structures, atoms
* Redux: centralised state
* Reagent, Re-frame: implicit reactivity
* Redux, Re-frame: global event broadcast
* Erlang: pattern matching
* Haskell: higher order functions
* Rust: ownership and lifetimes
