## Reading vs Writing

Reading and writing are fundamentally different.


Data should be dumb. Reading should be described in terms of reading data
by address (path, url, etc.).

Stupid data is better than custom getter logic.


Writing should be described in terms of domain-specific commands.

Controlled writing logic is better than stupidly setting data to objects in memory.
