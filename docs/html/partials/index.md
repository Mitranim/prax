## Overview

Prax is:
* an architecture for realtime applications
* a library implementing that architecture

Prax is designed to complement React or any React-style rendering library. Its
concepts are applicable to more than just GUI apps.

Heavily borrows from Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, and others. Somewhat similar to
Redux, but much more feature-complete.
